# Text-Editor24

## Description
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Installation
This application will require the installation of Node.js and various npm packages.

This application will use the following npm packages:-

  * npm install express
  * npm install --save-dev webpack 
  * npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev 
  * npm install --save-dev webpack-pwa-manifest 
  * npm install babel 
  * npm install --save-dev css-loader 
  * npm install concurrently --save  
  * npm npm install idb 

The required modules are bundled in the package.json file and at CLI or integrated terminal, type in npm run install, the modules will be installed.

## Usage
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I load my web application THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox WHEN I register a service worker THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
